# Dice Game ICS3UI

I coded this using web development languages HTML/JS/CSS, but mainly JS
The HTML/CSS component is basic formatting, but it works by using JS to append messages to the main text div
Some things are less verbose in a high-level language like JS, which made it faster to program the main components
However, some functionality is limited, which became a problem near the end of the project.
I intended to use the webpage to enhance the presentation and develop a more user-friendly interface
But I got too caught up on debugging in the past two weeks and was unable to spend much time on the format/layout
There are still some bugs, but I think that I covered most of the main aspects of the project

I did not learn much about syntactical structure or programming applications from this assignment, 
but it definitely taught me a lot about what I need to improve on in my coding process
I now understand the importance of writing well-defined methods and the need for test cases when debugging
I will try to implement these techniques when writing my final project in order to produce an end result that 
is more error-free and understandable
